I may have forgotten obscure C functions because I dont actively try to learn more about C, I like using C to implement ideas. I prefer C because it's a really straightforward language. Though, I will admit 
that some tasks that may seem trivial in other languages, can take significantly more time in C. 

One thing I've noticed is that I find bugs more quickly now. My logic is that if you think about what the function does, how it does what it does, what can go wrong, it builds a vivid picture in your mind, that allows you to quickly find which instruction is causing unexpected behavior. 

I dont think I've ever used GDB to debug my programs, and have actually saved time, might just be because I'm incompotent, but my go-to method for debugging is printing "Here 1" , "Here 2" at least for trivial bugs.
